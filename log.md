##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project about creating a web app that I can use to generate email. The project will use node.js and express.js. I created the INDEX and NEW routes, added bootstrap on project as well

**Thoughts** I have been learning Node.js and Express.js for about a month now, all with tutorial video code along, althought I learned a lot of new things, I think I will need to start a project to fully understand a lot of the stuff that I learned. I start to use github the 1st time. Even with the simple project like forking the repo. I learned some new things today.

### Day 2: Jan 4th, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: continued to work on the same project. Added navbar with bootstrap. Then installed mongodb to store data. created the notification schema and working on seed file to feed data to the DB for testing.

**Thoughts** Today I need to go back to some of the code along codes to look for what I need for the project. For bootstrap, I started to look up the pieces that I need on the documentation. It is harder to try to figure what I need to do in a real project than just coding along with tutorial. But by looking up old code and looking up information on the internet really help me learn. And I am happy to know that if I got stuck with something, I know where to look for what I need to continue.

### Day 3: Jan 5th, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created CRETAE route, to post input from input form to mongodb. Installed body-parser to parse form data to allow the route to put data into the db. The form can correctly add date to the db and the index page will display the data added.

**Thoughts** I found myself looking up a lot of infomatin in order to get what I needed to make the RESTFul route to work. spent sometime on debugging due to the from will not parse the data to db and keep throw a error. Turn out I forget to install software package in order for it to work. Coded for an hour and happy with progress so far.

### Day 4: Jan 6th, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Created SHOW route and updated index page with some bootstrap. created EDIT route to edit each entry to the db. But need more debugging

**Thoughts** I started to feel less frustrated with bugs, when something is not working, I start to accept it things are not always work at the 1st go. I will look on the internet and to debug with my best ability.

### Day 5: Jan 7th, 2017 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: modified EDIT route with bootstrap to look nice. created UPDATE route to update db. installed method-override package to use PUT method, but need debug

**Thoughts** I ran into a bug that I couldn't fix for about 30 mins, for bootstrap, i am a lot more comfortable to look for example on the bootstrap website. Overall I am happy the progress. Seem like bugs are inevitable when you working on a project. I am getting stuck, I think the best way to deal with them is to stop now and start later.


### Day 6: Jan 8th, 2017 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed update route, it is now updating the db correctly. created DELETE route, also created the new channels page. looked up more infomation on how to use bootstrap. Also use javascript to put a default value on the date picker since html will not allow to assign default value using value attr for current date.

**Thoughts** I am so happy to get the bugs I had yesterday fixed. not sure what went wrong yesterday. I simplely re-writing the the update route, but I started with the simple res.send then add a piece at a time to finally get it working. I guess taking it one step at a time will allow me to catch the simple problem get it fix then move on the next problem is better to have a block of non-working code and don't know where to start to fix.
