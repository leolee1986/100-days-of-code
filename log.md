##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Jan 3rd, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started the project about creating a web app that I can use to generate email. The project will use node.js and express.js. I created the INDEX and NEW routes, added bootstrap on project as well

**Thoughts** I have been learning Node.js and Express.js for about a month now, all with tutorial video code along, althought I learned a lot of new things, I think I will need to start a project to fully understand a lot of the stuff that I learned. I start to use github the 1st time. Even with the simple project like forking the repo. I learned some new things today.
